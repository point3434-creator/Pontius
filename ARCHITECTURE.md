The Python package implements `game-core`, `exact-lab`, the reference portion
of `solver-core`, and a small experimental public-belief/online-search control.
The Bayesian continual compositor is a rejected negative control, not the
production resolver. `safe_resolving` is the exact two-player correctness
control: its chance root uses chance × resolver reach, its opponent opt-out
information sets carry blueprint counterfactual-best-response values, and only
the resolver component is exported. Its full-game target remains outside
policy construction. Performance backends and future approximate gadgets must
remain differentially testable against this implementation.

The safe frontier interface is vector-valued. Each opponent augmented root
information set has counterfactual reach, blueprint CBR value, candidate CBR
value, and positive violation. Finite-solver error is a first-class certificate,
not an unreported convergence assumption. Exact best-response certification is
permitted only in the laboratory; a scalable system will need conservative
value bounds or a permanent no-op fallback.

## Runtime target

The final agent will always have an immediate blueprint fallback. CPU code will
construct and mutate trees. Stable tree epochs and neural leaf batches may run
on the GPU. Current-decision jobs preempt speculative future work. No cached
strategy is reused without validating its public state, belief representation,
blueprint version, and provenance.

## Dependency direction

Game definitions do not depend on solvers. Exact evaluation and solvers depend
only on the generic game interface. Models and optimized runtimes must not
become required dependencies for correctness tests.
