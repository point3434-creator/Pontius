# Project Status

## Active checkpoint

Checkpoint 2: solver comparison laboratory.

## Verified state

- Workspace initialized as a clean Git repository.
- Initial project scope, measurement contract, architecture, risks, and roadmap
  are recorded.
- Bundled Python runtime is available; system Python and CMake are not currently
  on `PATH`.
- The generic finite-game interface and exact two-player Kuhn rules are
  implemented.
- Exact expected utility, pure information-set best response, deviation gain,
  NashConv, and exploitability are implemented.
- Full-tree alternating CFR and LCFR share one traversal and pass 14 automated
  tests in the initial commit.
- At 20,000 sequential reference iterations, CFR reached NashConv `0.00014427`
  in 3.911 seconds and LCFR reached `0.00000859` in 3.917 seconds. Both matched
  Kuhn's analytical player-0 value of `-1/18` within numerical tolerance.
- Configurable two-to-six-player Kuhn implements the explicit rules in
  `ADR-0005` and now passes a total of 23 automated tests.
- The exact dynamic perfect-recall best response matches exhaustive policy
  enumeration in two-player tests and is locally undominated in a three-player
  cross-check.
- At 5,000 three-player iterations, CFR reached NashConv `0.00077954`; LCFR
  reached `0.00001229`. This advances LCFR as the control without establishing
  multiplayer convergence.
- Uniform-profile exact evaluation took approximately 0.001, 0.014, 0.249,
  4.940, and 106.623 seconds for two through six players respectively.

## In progress

- Adding CFR+ and DCFR through the existing update interface.
- Designing controlled leaf-value perturbations and tree-mutation experiments.
- Reducing evaluation overhead through configurable cadence and future
  restricted responders.

## Next three tasks

1. Refactor regret weighting into explicit update policies for CFR+, DCFR, and
   future predictive variants.
2. Compare CFR, LCFR, CFR+, and DCFR under equal iterations and wall time.
3. Add the first controlled leaf-error and warm-start experiments.

## Current blockers

None.

## Required reading before continuation

1. `PROJECT.md`
2. `STATUS.md`
3. `ROADMAP.md`
4. Relevant records under `docs/decisions/`

## Last updated

2026-08-18, after passing checkpoint C1 and completing EXP-0002/EXP-0003.
